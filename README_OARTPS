This commit uses GSI-utils as a submodule for python utility.
Run "git submodule update --init --recursive" after cloning.


In order to use obs-aware RTPS, the following two steps are performed

(1) Create mask file "fv3sar_tile1_mask" by running python utility
    "mrms2fv3grid.py" located in GSI-utils/src/python_utilities/bin

    USAGE:
    	  python mrms2fv3grid <MASK_THRESHOLD>

    where <MASK_THRESHOLD> is an optional command-line parameter to 
    define dbz threshold for mask (default is 35.0)

    The utility requires 3 input files: 
	- Gridded_ref.nc 	    (3d mrms reflectivity data)
	- fv3sar_tile1_grid_spec.nc (horizontal grid file)
	- fv3sar_tile1_akbk.nc      (vertical grid file)

    Python modules required to run utility:
	- netCDF4
	- numpy
	- scipy


(2) To activate obs-aware RTPS in EnKF run, add the following parameters 
    to namelist enkf.nml within the &nam_enkf section


  if_adaptive_inflate = .true.,  ! turn on the obs-aware RTPS (default .false.)
  reduced_infl_factor = 0.31579, ! the reduced inflation factor value (default 1.0)
  if_reduce_hydrometeor_inflation_only = .true., ! only apply reduced_infl_factor to the hydrometeor fields (default .false.)
  phy_smaller_domain  = .true. ! phyvars use a slight smaller domain than the remaining variables for the LBC update in DA (default .false.)


*Note that "reduced_infl_factor" is multiplicative to the value of analpertwt (RTPS alpha)
For example, if analpertwt = 0.95 and reduced_infl_factor = 0.31579,
then the RTPS alpha over non-precipitating locations would be 0.95 * 0.31579 = 0.3
Which will be applied to only hydrometeor variables if if_reduce_hydrometeor_inflation_only is .true.
